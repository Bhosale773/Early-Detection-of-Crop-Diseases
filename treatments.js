    "Apple_Leaf_Scab":{
        "symptoms":"The first visible symptoms of apple scab appear in the spring in the form of minute, circular, olive-green spots on leaves, often along a main vein. As they enlarge, they become brownish-black and eventually coalesce to form large patches of necrotic tissue. Affected leaves are often deformed and fall off prematurely, leading to defoliation in case of heavy infections. On shoots, the infections causes blistering and cracking that can then provide entry for opportunistic pathogens. On the fruits, brown to dark brown circular areas appear on the surface. As they develop further, they often coalesce and become raised, hard and corky. This restricts the expansion of the fruit and leads to distortion and cracking of the skin that expose the flesh. Light attacks do not affect the fruit quality significantly. However, the scabs can expose the fruits to opportunistic pathogens and rots, reducing the storage capacity and the quality.",
        "causes":"Apple scab is a disease caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It survives the winter mainly on infected leaves on the ground but also on bud scales or lesions on wood. At the onset of spring, the fungus resumes growth and starts to produce spores, which are later discharged and dispersed over long distances by the wind. These spores land on developing leaves and fruits and start a new infection. Outer parts of unopened fruit buds are highly susceptible to scab. However, as the fruit matures it becomes much less susceptible. Humid environment, wetting period of leaves or fruits are essential for the infection. Alternative hosts include shrubs of the genus Cotoneaster, Pyracantha and Sorbus. All apple varieties are susceptible to scab, with Gala being more vulnerable.",
        "bioControl":"If disease levels were high the previous season, liquid copper fungicides can be sprayed to impede the fungal growth on the tree during the winter season. Sulfur sprays are only partially effective against apple scab. However, solutions containing sulfur and pyrethrins are available for organic control of the disease during the growing season.",
        "chemControl":"The management of apple scab using chemical controls is primarily concerned with preventing the initiation of primary infection cycles by reducing the germination of ascospores. As such, fungicides are typically applied early in the season, when ascospores are first released. However, fungicide applications may also be made later in the season to prevent infection of old leaves, which can help reduce the amount of primary inoculum for the following season. Benzimidazole fungicides are among the most commonly-used classes of fungicide for managing apple scab in conventional orchards; however, there is some evidence that the disease is developing resistance to this class of fungicides, along with several others, including demethylation inhibitors and quinone outside inhibitors. To manage the development of fungicide resistance, growers can reduce the number of applications made throughout the season and alternate between different classes of fungicide. In organic production systems, growers commonly use copper- or sulfur-based protectant sprays to reduce the efficacy of primary inoculum. Although these sprays were among the earliest methods of preventing the development of apple scab, they do little to manage pre-existing infections and application may significantly damage the foliage of treated trees. Moreover, research has indicated that applications of copper-based fungicides may result in changes in the structure and functionality of soil microbiota, thus having a negative effect on soil health. As such, alternative management strategies appropriate for organic production systems are currently being developed."

Gradually these lesions will turn grayish and appear on younger leaves, too. As the disease progresses, they enlarge into elongated, rectangular lesions that run parallel to the leaf veins. In optimal conditions (warm temperatures, high humidity and wet leaves), they can coalesce and engulf the whole leaf. If this happens before grain filling there can be considerable yield losses. The leaf blight can weaken the plants and sometimes soften the stalks, leading to lodging.",
        "causes":"The gray leaf spot disease is caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae-maydis. It survives in plant residues in the soil for long periods of time. During the spring, the spores are carried onto the lower leaves by rain splashes and wind. Its lifecycle is favored by elevated temperatures (25 to 30Â°C), high humidity (dews, fogs) and leaf wetness for prolonged periods of time. Hot, dry weather hinders its development. Symptoms vary slightly between different plant varieties. The fungus completes its lifecycle (from infection to production of new spores) in 14-21 days in a susceptible variety and in 21-28 days in a resistant one.",
        "bioControl":"No biological control is available  to control this disease.",
        "chemControl":" Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures and biological treatments if available. Foliar fungicide treatment is a way to manage the disease if it occurs at early stages but it has to be weighted against the weather conditions, the potential yield loss and the susceptibility of the plant. Fungicides containing pyraclostrobin and strobilurin, or combinations of azoxystrobin and propiconazole, prothioconazole and trifloxystrobin work well to control the fungus."
    },
    "Corn_Leaf_Common_Rust":{
        "symptoms":"Minute flecks appear on both sides of the leaves and slowly develop into small, tan, slightly raised spots. These mainly elongated spots later turn into powdery, golden-brown pustules loosely scattered in patches on upper and lower sides. The color can change to black as the plant matures. Contrarily to other rust diseases, symptoms are not usually present on other plant parts, such as stalks, sheath leaves or husks. However, stalks tend to grow weak and soft and are prone to lodging. Younger leaf tissue is more susceptible to fungal infection than mature leaves. Plants infected during the early stages can show chlorosis of leaves and death, leading to high yield losses if upper leaves are affected.",
        "causes":"The disease is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. The fungus overwinters in an alternate host (a species of Oxalis) and releases spores during the spring. The spores can be transported over great distances by winds and rain. They start the infection process when landing on the leaves. Secondary infection from plant to plant can also occur due to wind and rain. The development of the disease is favored by high relative humidities (nearly 100%), dew, rain and cool temperatures between 15 and 20Â°C (may vary depending on area). Hot, dry weather will in turn slow or hinder the development of the fungus and the incidence of the disease. It is more a problem in plants used for seed production and sweet corn. Plants cultivated as livestock feed, for industrial products, or to make processed foods are not concerned. Yield is reduced due to lower plant productivity and lodging.",
        "bioControl":"No alternative treatment against Puccinia sorghi is available so far. Please get in touch with us in case you know of anything that might help to fight this disease. Looking forward to hearing from you.",
        "chemControl":"Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. The application of fungicides can be beneficial when used on susceptible varieties. Apply a foliar fungicide early in the season if rust is bound to spread rapidly due to the weather conditions. Numerous fungicides are available for rust control. Products containing mancozeb, pyraclostrobin, pyraclostrobin + metconazole, pyraclostrobin + fluxapyroxad, azoxystrobin + propiconazole, trifloxystrobin + prothioconazole can be used to control the disease. An example of treatment could be: Spraying of mancozeb @ 2.5 g/l as soon as pustules appear and repeat at 10 days interval till flowering."

    "Corn_Northern_Leaf_Blight":{
        "symptoms":"The symptoms appear as small, oval, water-soaked spots on the lower leaves first. As the disease progresses, they start to appear on the upper part of the plant. Older spots slowly grow into tan, long cigar-shaped necrotic lesions with distinct dark specks and pale green, water-soaked borders. These lesions later coalesce and engulf a large part of the leaf blade and stalk, sometimes leading to death and lodging. If the infection spreads to the upper parts of the plant during the development of the cob. Severe yield losses can occur (up to 70%).",
        "causes":"The fungus overwinters in the soil or on plant debris.  Rainfall, night dew, high humidity and moderate temperatures favor the dispersion of the the fungus. Carried by wind or rain splashes it first spreads from the soil onto the lower leaves of young maize plants. Rainy conditions and poor field practices favor its spread to other plants and within fields. Optimal temperatures for infection are in the range of 18 to 27Â°C during the growing season. A prolonged period of 6 to 18 hours of leaf wetness are also necessary. Sorghum is another favorite host of the fungus.",
        "bioControl":"Bio-fungicides based on Trichoderma harzianum, or Bacillus subtilis can be applied at different stages to decrease the risk of infection. Application of sulfur solutions is also effective.",
        "chemControl":"Fungicides are available to help manage northern corn leaf blight. These fungicides will help to minimize yield loss; however, keep in mind other economic factors when determining how valuable this management method would be. The most important area to prevent infection from reaching is the ear leaves and above, which is another factor to consider when deciding whether or not a fungicide is necessary. In this case, scout corn fields right before tassel emergence. If infection is already bad, this is the period in which the fungus can be controlled most effectively. Fungicides with the following active ingredients have proven to be effective for the management of northern corn leaf blight: picoxystrobin (AproachÂ®), tetraconazole (DomarkÂ®), pyraclostrobin (HeadlineÂ® AMP), azoxystrobin (QuadrisÂ®), and propiconazole (TiltÂ®). Always be sure to carefully read the label for cautions and proper application before use."

The fruit will become deformed and eventually be shriveled and black mummified.",
        "causes":"The damage is caused by the fungus Phyllosticta ampelicida. The pathogen overwinters in infested shoots or fruit mummies on the grapevine or the soil. The spores will be ejected by light rainfall and then dispersed via wind. Optimal growth conditions are met at 25Â°C and 6 hours of constant leaf wetness. The fungus prefers warm and humid weather. Reduced fruit yield.",
        "bioControl":"Immediately after blooming stage you can spray Bacillus thuringiensis.",
        "chemControl":"Chemical applications are done in a preventive manner. Start spraying roughly two weeks before bloom with captan + mycobutanil or mancozeb + mycobutanil. Just before the blossoms open you can also use carbaryl or imidcloprid. Post-bloom spray mancozeb + mycobutanil, imidacloprid or azadirachtin. Ten days after bloom you can also apply a mixture of captan and sulfur on your vines. Because most grape varieties become resistant to the infection three to four weeks after bloom, chemical sprays should be avoided at that time."

    "Grape_Leaf_Esca_Black_Measles":{
        "symptoms":"The disease may occur at any time during the growing season. The main symptom is an interveinal 'striping' on the leaves, which is characterized by the discoloration and drying of the tissues around the main veins. It usually shows as dark red in red varieties and yellow in white ones. Leaves can dry out completely and drop prematurely. On berries, small, round, dark spots, often bordered by a brown-purple ring, may occur. These fruit spots may appear at any time between fruit set and ripening. In severely affected vines, the berries often crack and dry. Cross-sectional cuts through affected canes, spurs, cordons, or trunks reveal concentric rings formed by dark spots. A severe form of Esca known as 'apoplexy' results in a sudden dieback of the entire vine.",
        "causes":"The symptoms are mainly caused by the fungus Togninia minima but other fungi can also be involved (for example Phaeomoniella chlamydospora). The infection actually occurs in younger vines but the symptoms may first become apparent in vineyards after 5-7 years.  The fungi survive the winter in overwintering structures embedded in the woody parts of the vines. During fall to spring rainfall, spores are produced and released and may infect wounds done during dormant pruning. Wounds may remain susceptible to infection for several weeks after pruning. After a pruning wound is infected, the pathogen establishes a permanent, localized wood infection, which cannot be eradicated by fungicide applications.",
        "bioControl":"Soak dormant cuttings for 30 mins in hot water at about 50Â°C. This treatment is not always effective and must therefore be combined with other methods. Some species of Trichoderma have been used to prevent the infection of pruning wounds, basal ends of propagation material, and graft unions. This treatment has to be carried out within 24 hours of pruning and again 2 weeks after.",
        "chemControl":"Always consider an integrated approach with preventive measures together with biological treatments if available. Chemical strategies to control this disease are difficult, since the traditional wound protectants do not penetrate deep enough in the dormant grapevine cuttings to affect the fungi. Preventive practices are the most effective management approach for all trunk diseases. For example, immediately before grafting, vines can be deeped into specialized waxes containing plant growth regulators or fungicide-impregnated formulations. This encourages graft union callus development while inhibiting fungal contamination."
